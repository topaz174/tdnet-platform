## Query Processing Pipelines

### Standard Pipeline (Simple/Moderate Queries)
```python

query → classify → identify_companies → route_to_structured_processor → synthesize
```

### Complex Pipeline (Multi-source Analysis)
```python
# Example: "Compare Toyota and Honda's profitability trends"
query → classify → identify_companies → parallel_processing(structured + narrative) → hybrid_synthesis
```

### Expert Pipeline (Institutional Analysis)
```python
# Example: "Comprehensive automotive sector analysis with investment recommendations"
query → classify → multi_dimensional_analysis → expert_synthesis → validation → adequacy_evaluation
```

## Query Classification System

### Query Types
- **STRUCTURED**: Pure numerical data queries (revenue, ratios, financial metrics)
- **UNSTRUCTURED**: Narrative analysis (strategy, risks, management outlook)
- **HYBRID**: Requires both numbers and narrative context
- **CONTEXTUAL**: Numbers first, then explanatory context

### Complexity Levels
- **SIMPLE**: Single metric, single company
- **MODERATE**: Multiple metrics or companies
- **COMPLEX**: Cross-company analysis, trends
- **EXPERT**: Multi-dimensional analysis with comprehensive context

## Company Identification Features

### Identification Methods
1. **Explicit Mentions**
   - Ticker codes: "7203" → Toyota Motor
   - Company names: "Toyota", "トヨタ自動車" → Toyota Motor
   - English names: "Sony Group" → Sony

2. **Sector-based Identification**
   - "automotive companies" → Toyota, Honda, Nissan (top by market cap)
   - "tech companies" → Sony, Hitachi, SoftBank

3. **Comparative Queries**
   - "Compare Toyota with Honda"
   - "Toyota vs Honda performance"
   - "Between Sony and Panasonic"

4. **LLM-powered Fallback**
   - Complex mentions requiring contextual understanding
   - Ambiguous references resolved through AI

### Confidence Scoring
- Ticker matches: 0.95 confidence
- Exact name matches: 0.90 confidence
- Sector-based: 0.70 confidence
- Fuzzy matches: Variable based on similarity
- LLM identification: 0.50 default

## Answer Adequacy Evaluation

### Evaluation Criteria
The ReasoningAgent evaluates each response across five dimensions:

1. **Completeness (25%)**: Does it fully answer the question?
2. **Accuracy (25%)**: Are facts and numbers correct?
3. **Relevance (20%)**: Is information pertinent to the query?
4. **Clarity (15%)**: Is the response well-structured?
5. **Actionability (15%)**: Does it provide actionable insights?

### Adequacy Scoring
- **≥0.8**: Excellent response quality
- **0.7-0.79**: Good quality, minor improvements possible
- **0.6-0.69**: Adequate quality, some issues identified
- **<0.6**: Poor quality, significant improvements needed

### Automatic Improvement Suggestions
For low-scoring responses, the system automatically suggests:
- Missing information to include
- Areas requiring better explanation
- Structural improvements needed
- Additional context required

## Data Source Integration

### Structured Data (XBRL)
```sql
-- Example query structure
SELECT 
    fm.ticker,
    fm.period_end_date,
    fm.metric_name,
    fm.metric_value_jpy
FROM financial_metrics fm
JOIN documents d ON fm.document_id = d.id
WHERE fm.ticker = %s AND fm.metric_name IN (%s, %s, ...)
```

### Unstructured Data (Documents)
- Vector similarity search for relevant documents
- Enhanced query construction with company and metric context
- Document ranking and filtering
- Narrative synthesis from multiple sources

## Performance Monitoring

### Tracked Metrics
- **Response Time**: Query processing duration
- **Confidence Scores**: Analysis confidence levels
- **Error Rates**: Failed query percentage
- **Adequacy Scores**: Answer quality metrics

### Performance Trends
- Rolling averages over recent queries
- Comparative analysis across time periods
- Automated performance reporting

## Usage Examples

### Basic Financial Query
```python
agent = ProductionHybridFinancialAgent(sql_db, vector_retriever, llm)
result = await agent.process_query("What was Toyota's revenue growth in 2023?")

# Result includes:
# - Structured financial data
# - Narrative analysis
# - Synthesis combining both
# - Confidence and adequacy scores
```

### Comparative Analysis
```python
result = await agent.process_query(
    "Compare the profitability of Toyota and Honda over the last 3 years"
)

# Automatically identifies both companies
# Retrieves comparative financial data
# Provides trend analysis and insights
```

### Sector Analysis
```python
result = await agent.process_query(
    "Analyze the automotive sector's performance and provide investment recommendations"
)

# Expert-level analysis pipeline
# Multi-company analysis
# Investment-grade recommendations
# Comprehensive risk assessment
```

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

### Company Identification Failures
When companies cannot be identified:
- Clear error message explaining the issue
- Suggestions for rephrasing the query
- Examples of valid company identifiers

### Database Connection Issues
- Graceful fallback to cached company data
- Error logging and monitoring
- User-friendly error messages

### LLM Processing Errors
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Fallback to simpler processing approaches
- Detailed error logging for debugging

## Configuration and Deployment

### Required Dependencies
```python
# Core dependencies
langchain
pandas
numpy
asyncio
psycopg2  # for PostgreSQL
difflib   # for fuzzy matching
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
PG_DSN="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/financial_db"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"  # Optional for caching
```

### Database Schema Requirements

-- Core tables needed
financial_metrics (ticker, period_end_date, metric_name, metric_value_jpy, document_id)
documents (id, ticker, company_name, release_datetime, category)
company_master (ticker, company_name, company_name_en, sector, market_cap_jpy)
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Enhanced Retrieval System Compatibility
The agent is designed to work with the existing enhanced retrieval system:
- Uses existing 1536-dim embeddings

- Leverages existing classification columns

### Migration from Legacy Agents
- Drop-in replacement for basic agent implementations
- Backwards compatible with existing query patterns
- Enhanced functionality without breaking changes

## Best Practices

### Query Formulation
- **Specific Company Names**: Use official company names or tickers
- **Clear Time Periods**: Specify "2023", "last 3 years", "Q1 2024"
- **Explicit Metrics**: Mention specific financial metrics when needed
- **Analysis Type**: Indicate if comparison, trend, or valuation analysis is desired

### Performance Optimization
- Use async processing for multiple queries
- Leverage conversation memory for follow-up questions
- Monitor performance metrics for system optimization
- Cache frequently accessed company data

### Quality Assurance
- Review adequacy scores for answer quality

- **Enhanced Validation**: Implement domain-specific validation rules
- **Custom Adequacy Criteria**: Tailor evaluation criteria for specific use cases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No companies identified" Error
- **Cause**: Query doesn't contain recognizable company references
- **Solution**: Include specific company names, tickers, or sectors
- **Example Fix**: "Toyota revenue" instead of "automotive revenue"

#### Low Adequacy Scores
- **Cause**: Insufficient data or unclear query intent
- **Solution**: Rephrase query with more specific requirements
- **Check**: Review reasoning notes for specific improvement suggestions

#### Slow Response Times
- **Cause**: Complex queries with multiple companies or extensive time periods
- **Solution**: Break complex queries into smaller parts
- **Optimization**: Use conversation memory for follow-up questions

#### Database Connection Errors
- **Cause**: PostgreSQL connection issues or missing tables
- **Solution**: Verify database configuration and schema
- **Fallback**: System uses cached company data when possible
