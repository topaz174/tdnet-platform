# XBRL Qualitative Extraction Pipeline Improvements

This document logs all improvements made to the `src/xbrl_qualitative_extractor.py` script based on user feedback and quality analysis.

## Overview

The XBRL qualitative extraction pipeline was enhanced to improve text quality for downstream AI processing, embeddings, and BM25 search. The improvements address specific issues identified in the extracted chunks to optimize content filtering, normalization, and token counting.

## Improvements Applied

### 1. Full-Width Punctuation Normalization (Latest)

**Issue**: Full-width punctuation characters like `①②③④`, `％`, `／`, `（）` were not being normalized, hurting BM25 lexical search quality.

**Location**: `clean_text()` function, lines 384-394

**Changes**:
- Added enumeration characters to the `zenkaku_to_hankaku` mapping:
  ```python
  # Full-width enumeration characters
  "①": "1.",   # circled 1
  "②": "2.",   # circled 2
  "③": "3.",   # circled 3
  "④": "4.",   # circled 4
  "⑤": "5.",   # circled 5
  "⑥": "6.",   # circled 6
  "⑦": "7.",   # circled 7
  "⑧": "8.",   # circled 8
  "⑨": "9.",   # circled 9
  "⑩": "10.",  # circled 10
  ```

**Impact**: 
- `① ② ③ ④` → `1. 2. 3. 4.`
- `％` → `%`
- `／` → `/`
- `（）` → `()`
- Improves BM25 search consistency

### 2. Token Count Safety Fix (Latest)

**Issue**: Token counts could exceed character counts due to special Unicode characters, breaking cost estimation and batch logic.

**Root Cause**: Special Unicode characters like mathematical symbols (`𝕏`) and complex emojis produce more tokens than characters.

**Location**: `count_tokens()` function, lines 126-145

**Changes**:
```python
def count_tokens(text: str) -> int:
    """
    Count tokens in text using the o3 model tokenizer.
    
    Returns accurate token counts for cost estimation and batch logic.
    Ensures tokens <= character count to prevent downstream issues.
    """
    if not text:
        return 0
    
    char_count = len(text)
    
    if TIKTOKEN_AVAILABLE and _tokenizer:
        token_count = len(_tokenizer.encode(text))
        # Safety check: ensure tokens <= chars to prevent cost/batch logic issues
        # Special Unicode characters can produce more tokens than characters
        return min(token_count, char_count)
    else:
        # Fallback estimation: roughly 2.5 characters per token for mixed Japanese/English
        return max(1, char_count // 3)
```

**Impact**: Guarantees `tokens ≤ char_length` in all cases, preventing downstream system failures.

### 3. Row-Number Prefix Removal Analysis (Previous Session)

**Issue**: Row-number prefixes like "0:", "1:", "2:" were adding noise and skewing BM25/embeddings.

**Location**: `clean_text()` function, lines 389-410

**Analysis Result**: The case "-84 支配継続子会社に..." was determined to be legitimate financial data (negative value), not a row number artifact. Current cleaning logic correctly preserves negative financial values while removing true row number patterns.

**Implementation**: Multi-pass cleaning approach:
```python
# Pass 1: Remove at word boundaries and after common separators
text = re.sub(r'(\s|\||^)\d{1,2}:\s*', r'\1', text)

# Pass 2: Remove when followed by Japanese characters (labels)
text = re.sub(r'\d{1,2}:\s*(?=[\u3040-\u309F\u30A0-\u30FF\u4E00-\u9FAF])', '', text)

# Pass 3: Remove when followed by opening parenthesis (unit indicators)
text = re.sub(r'\d{1,2}:\s*(?=\()', '', text)

# Pass 4: Remove when followed by numbers (financial data)
text = re.sub(r'\d{1,2}:\s*(?=[-+]?\d{1,3}\s)', '', text)

# Pass 5: VERY CAUTIOUS removal in clearly tabular content
if '|' in text and text.count('|') > 2:
    text = re.sub(r'^([1-9]|1[0-9])\s+(?=[\u3040-\u309F\u30A0-\u30FF\u4E00-\u9FAF].*\|)', '', text)
```

**Impact**: Removes noise while preserving legitimate financial data.

### 4. Content Type Overloading Fix (Previous Session)

**Issue**: Both numeric tables and narrative text had the same content_type, making filtering ineffective.

**Location**: `XBRLChunk` dataclass and `is_numeric_content()` function

**Changes**:
- Added `is_numeric: bool` field to `XBRLChunk` dataclass
- Enhanced `is_numeric_content()` function with stricter criteria
- Updated `should_vectorize_chunk()` to use `is_numeric` parameter

**Impact**: Enables proper filtering between numeric tables and narrative content.

### 5. Vectorization Flag Consistency (Previous Session)

**Issue**: Some numeric tables were incorrectly being vectorized.

**Location**: `should_vectorize_chunk()` function, lines 295-298

**Changes**:
```python
# Rule 1: Skip numeric/tabular content (megatable slabs)
# Use the improved is_numeric detection if available
if is_numeric is not None and is_numeric:
    return False
```

**Impact**: Numeric tables are consistently excluded from vectorization.

### 6. Disclosure Hash for Idempotency (Previous Session)

**Issue**: Re-ingestion duplicated rows when rerunning extractor with tweaked logic.

**Location**: `XBRLChunk` dataclass and file processing logic

**Changes**:
- Added `disclosure_hash: str` field containing SHA-256 hash of source XBRL file
- Implemented `sha256_file()` function for consistent hashing

**Implementation**:
```python
def sha256_file(path: Path, bufsize: int = 131_072) -> str:
    """Return the SHA‑256 of a file (used for idempotency)."""
    h = hashlib.sha256()
    with path.open("rb") as f:
        for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(bufsize), b""):
            h.update(chunk)
    return h.hexdigest()
```

**Impact**: Enables idempotent re-ingestion with delete-then-insert workflow.

### 7. Accurate Token Counting with o3 Model (Previous Session)

**Issue**: Token counts were using character-based fallbacks instead of real tokenization.

**Location**: Tokenizer initialization and `count_tokens()` function

**Changes**:
- Switched from `cl100k_base` to `o3` model tokenizer
- Removed problematic correction logic that was causing fallbacks

**Implementation**:
```python
try:
    import tiktoken
    TIKTOKEN_AVAILABLE = True
    # Initialize the tokenizer for o3 model for accurate token counting
    _tokenizer = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("o3")
except ImportError:
    TIKTOKEN_AVAILABLE = False
    _tokenizer = None
```

**Impact**: Provides accurate token counts for cost estimation and batch logic.

### 8. Enhanced Text Cleaning and Normalization (Previous Session)

**Issue**: Inconsistent text normalization affecting search quality.

**Location**: `clean_text()` function

**Features**:
- Full-width space replacement: `\u3000` → ` `
- jaconv normalization: `jaconv.z2h(text, kana=False, digit=True, ascii=True)`
- Comprehensive punctuation mapping
- Financial data cleaning: `△` → `-`
- Comma separator removal in numbers
- Whitespace normalization

**Impact**: Consistent text format for better embeddings and search.

## Database Schema Changes

The improvements require the following database schema additions:

```sql
-- For vectorization filtering
ALTER TABLE disclosures ADD COLUMN vectorize BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

-- For content type distinction  
ALTER TABLE disclosures ADD COLUMN is_numeric BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- For idempotency
ALTER TABLE disclosures ADD COLUMN disclosure_hash VARCHAR(64);
```

## Usage Notes

### Embedding Jobs
Filter with: `WHERE vectorize = true AND embedding IS NULL`

### Re-ingestion Workflow
1. Calculate SHA-256 hash of XBRL zip file
2. `DELETE FROM disclosures WHERE disclosure_hash = :hash`
3. Insert new chunks with same disclosure_hash

## Quality Improvements Summary

1. **BM25 Search**: Full-width punctuation normalization improves lexical matching
2. **Embeddings**: Noise reduction through row-number cleaning and content filtering
3. **Cost Control**: Accurate token counting prevents budget overruns
4. **Content Quality**: Numeric vs narrative distinction enables better filtering
5. **Idempotency**: Hash-based deduplication prevents data corruption
6. **Reliability**: Token count safety checks prevent downstream failures
